A way to quickly suss out the most important news elements in a story. 

Basically every "scoop" that's buried in a story (that isn't exclusive) is flagged by certain terms. We take those terms and check them
against the entire story to find out where all the scoops or interesting nuggets are. This doesn't work for exclusives or anything
like that for the time being (I'll get there eventually) and is largely a project to play around with website manipulation and
Beautiful Soup.
